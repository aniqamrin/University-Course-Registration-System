Title: Course Registration System

The system for managing university students' registration will allow Admins to freely add, update, or remove any course or course information, 
as well as generate reports regarding students and courses. 
Students will be able to view, register for, and drop courses, as well as generate and view their academic bills. 
Additionally, both Students and Facilitators will have the ability to message each other.
